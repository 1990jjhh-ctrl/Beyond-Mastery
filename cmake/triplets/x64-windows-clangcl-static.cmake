# mismatch.

# vcpkg turns VCPKG_CRT_LINKAGE into /MT only inside its own windows.cmake

# toolchain is chainloaded. This triplet chainloads, so without the options
# below VCPKG_CRT_LINKAGE would be silently ignored and every port would build
# /MD. CMP0091 NEW makes CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY take effect even in ports
# whose cmake_minimum_required predates it.
